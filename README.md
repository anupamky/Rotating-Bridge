# Rotating-Bridge
TA201 Course Project </br></br>
## PREFACE</br></br>
While we took three weeks to design the project, but we needed the accumulated knowledge, experience, and study of a lifetime during that time.</br>
We are third-year students of IITK's electrical engineering department. We always wanted to do our own metallurgical project, and the college provided us with the opportunity under the course TA201A, currently taught by Prof. Anish Upadhyaya.</br>
The design of every part has been given great detail as well as trying to satisfy its purpose so that it can be manufactured efficiently and effectively.</br></br>

## ABSTRACT</br></br>
We picked up the idea of rotating bridge for our project because we wished to construct a dynamic project that had some real-life applications. So, in our project we have displayed the problem that is faced by a stationary bridge and have presented a solution to it.</br>
The model consists of two rotating bridge halves each supported by a rotating pillar. The rotation mechanism is brought into action by bevel gear mechanism which are in turn rotated manually by a handle attached. Also, it consists of a conveyor belt with a ship to display how upon arrival of a ship with a sufficiently larger height the rotating bridge comes into action. To show the working of the project conveniently we have used a single axle which upon rotation causes both, the movement of the ship and rotation of bridges.</br></br>
